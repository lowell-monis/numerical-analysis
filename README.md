# Welcome!

This repository contains the computational work done by Lowell Monis for Dr. Di Liu's MTH 451 at Michigan State University during the Fall Semester of 2024.

## Quick Guide

In `hw-computational-tools`, you can find a few programs that act as computational tools for various numerical methods. These were used to solve the homework problems in the course. Many of these programs replicated the methods from scratch using algorithms in the ninth edition of Faires and Burden's textbook in _Numerical Analysis_ on Python. Built-in functions associated with the technique from scientific computing libraries were avoided and used instead to verify the accuracy of the programs I built.

In `project-notebooks`, you can find the Jupyter notebooks that I used to work out the project prompts for the two projects completed in this course. These were then converted into TeX-generated reports that you can find in `project-reports`. The final project for this course, where we worked on the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton Predictor Corrector Method in the Fourth Order, as well as an additional honors supplement that covers the Fourth Order Runge-Kutta Method with Adaptive Time Steps (Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg), can be found in `final-project`.
